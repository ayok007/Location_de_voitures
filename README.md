In this project, we present a mobile application that we developed as a mini project for our course on mobile application development. The project was assigned by our professor at the Polydisciplinary faculty of the university of Sultan Moulay Slimane in BÃ©ni Mellal. The objective of the project was to help us practice and apply the concepts and techniques of mobile application development that we learned in the course.

The mobile application that we developed is a car rental app that allows users to search, and book for car rentals in different locations. The app was developed using Android Studio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for creating Android applications. We used Firebase, which is a cloud-based platform that provides various services for mobile and web applications, such as authentication, database, storage, and analytics. The app has a user-friendly interface.
